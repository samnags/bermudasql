            <p>A study commissioned by the former government determined that the current airport terminal’s useful life ended in 2008. The building is well past its expiration date, and operating on borrowed time.

            Parts of the facility were built in the 1940s – nearly 70 years ago. The rest was added piecemeal – with additions built in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s. The result is a shabby, haphazard facility that is difficult to operate and expensive to maintain.

            Since the airport was built in phases, the parts built long ago are settling at a different rate then the newer ones. That means the facility is now twisting itself apart because it was not built on solid ground.

            When it rains outside it rains inside. The sewage system is below sea level so when the tide is high and the wind is in the east, the toilets at our airport do not flush. The carpeting and flooring has had to be replaced several times because the sewage comes up from underneath.

            Most alarming of all, the current terminal is in the worst possible location when it comes to exposure to severe weather. Hurricane winds often come out of the northeast into Castle Harbour. As a result, the sea builds itself up at precisely the area where the current airport stands, flooding it and its surroundings.

            After Hurricane Fahy, which was not a particularly strong hurricane, the airport suffered extensive damage. After Hurricane Fabian, the roof nearly collapsed, which would have completely destroyed the terminal. Next time we may not be so lucky.

            As long as the terminal is in its current location, it will always be susceptible to storm damage because it’s located too close to the water. That’s why the airport redevelopment project would move the terminal 300 meters away from Castle Harbour and raise it 5 meters above sea level to help protect the building from storm damage. Bermuda’s economy and people suffer when our airport has to be shut down, which is going to happen more and more often as long as we continue to neglect this problem.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Why not just repair the current airport?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There are some who argue that we should simply fix the current terminal rather than build a new one. Yet repairing the terminal would cost at least $115 million – and Bermuda would still be left with an old airport. The maintenance problems might go away temporarily, but it would still be the old airport with all its faults and inconveniences.

            The repaired facility would not have the features you find in modern airports, like jet bridges, and it would not be wheelchair-friendly. Above all, the airport would still be located too close to the water.</p>

          <strong>Claim: </strong>The Government is giving up hundreds of millions in revenue to Aecon.
          <br>
          <p><strong>The Truth: </strong>Bermuda’s Government is not giving anything away. Under the proposed arrangement, Aecon will pay all of the upfront costs of building the new terminal, and Aecon, not the Government, will have to pay for the operation of the airport for the next 30 years. As a result, revenue from the airport will go to pay Aecon for the material they’ll use to build the airport, for transporting it to Bermuda, and for the salaries and wages they’ll have to pay to their construction crews. Any money they earn will first go towards paying off the cost of construction. After that, Bermuda and Aecon will have a profit-sharing agreement, which will provide the government with a steady stream of income and make sure no profiteering is going on at Bermuda’s expense. So while we are not giving anything away, we still have to remember that this new airport isn’t going to be free. Aecon is building Bermuda a new airport at no upfront cost to the Bermuda government and without adding to the public debt, and they will have to be paid back for their investment.</p>

          <strong>Claim: </strong>Bermuda will not get a fair deal unless the airport project goes out to tender.
          <br>
          <p><strong>The Truth:</strong>
          The Bermuda Government has used the tender process for years on its large building projects, and has seen cost overruns totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. More and more, other countries are finding the same thing– asking for tenders, especially with big infrastructural projects, almost always results in cost overruns. That’s why many governments are finding public-private partnerships a better way to cost-effectively finance large infrastructure projects like airports. The arrangement we have made with the Canadian Commercial Corporation is a type of public-private partnership that involves no upfront spending for the airport by Bermuda, and no new debt for Bermuda. We are also given a guarantee by the Canadian Government that their project will be delivered on time, on budget, and according to specifications. That’s a huge plus for Bermuda’s taxpayers since it means there won’t be cost overruns – period.</p>

          <strong>Claim: </strong>The Government is trying to privatise the airport.
          <br>
            <p><strong>The Truth:</strong>
          All of the land and buildings that comprise the airport will continue to be owned with the Government of Bermuda. Aecon will not hold any ownership of the property or facilities. The title to the airport remains with the Bermuda Government. This is simply a partnership between a public enterprise and a private enterprise, similar to the public-private partnership which was used to build to our new hospital. The opposition did not object to that agreement. In fact, they helped arrange it.

          <strong>Claim: </strong>The new airport will be owned by Aecon, which could sell it at any time.
          <br>
            <p><strong>The Truth:</strong>
              Once again, the investors will not own the property or the facility. Aecon will be managing the airport for a 30-year period, but the title to the airport will remains with the Bermuda Government. No one has the power to sell our airport. The airport and all its assets will always be owned by Bermuda and her people.
